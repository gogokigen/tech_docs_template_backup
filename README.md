# The Good Docs Project templates

Does your project need docs but you don't know how to start?
The Good Docs Project templates can help.
Use the templates in this repository to create quality docs faster and easier for free.

We are an open-source project working to provide templates for a variety of common content types used in most software documentation projects.

## Table of contents

[TOC]


## Who the templates are for
Our templates are for anyone who wants to make better software documentation.
This includes:

* **Developers** who want to create good documentation for their software quickly and easily, but don't know where to start.
* **Documentation project owners** working in a docs-as-code model and who you want to provide templates to non-writers to help them write better documentation.
* **Technical writers** who want to standardize their documentation and draw inspiration from high-quality templates for their own templates or documentation projects.


## About the templates
Our templates are organized into **template packs.**
A template pack is a collection of templates organized together by:

* Common use cases or tasks.
* Needs of particular audiences or stakeholders.
* Popular or notable documentation frameworks.
* Maturity models for documentation.

If you are unsure which template pack is right for you, we recommend starting with the [Core documentation pack](#core-documentation-template-pack).
The core documentation pack is our flagship template pack and it includes the core, fundamental content types that every documentation project needs.
If you download one template pack for your project, it should be this one.

Each individual template within the template packs contains a set of files:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>File</th>
    <th>Example filename and purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Template file</td>
    <td><strong>template-content-type.md</strong><br><br>The template file is the raw template for the content type. It provides a rough outline of the suggested content and a few embedded writing tips for how to fill in the different sections of the template.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Template guide</td>
    <td><strong>guide-content-type.md</strong><br><br>This guide provides a deeper explanation of how to fill in the template. It provides a lightweight introduction to the purpose of this documentation and explains how to fill in each section of the document.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Resources</td>
    <td><strong>resources-content-type.md</strong><br><br>This document includes the resources (books, blog entries, guides) that the template author(s) used during the research phase of creating the template. It also includes any high-quality examples of that content type that served as inspiration for the template.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Process</td>
    <td><strong>process-content-type.md</strong><br><br>This document explains best practices for researching, writing, and maintaining this content type.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Example</td>
    <td><strong>example-content-type.md</strong><br><br>See an example of the template in action in our model documentation project: The Chronologue.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

NOTE: Not all templates contain all these files, but our goal is to eventually provide these files for each template.
